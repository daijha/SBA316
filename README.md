# SBA316
Hello again this is the README  for my third Skills Based Assesment (SBA) for coding bootcamp. This test was a lot more fun than the last one. The last one was so brutal that the letters SBA hurts to hear. Hahaha.... 

Anyways, I decided to repatch my heart together from the damage by creating a sweet webpage filled with affirmative speech. This page is for anyone to use when they need to hear some nice words. 

this project was made using mostly DOM manipulation along with some CSS styling and a little HTML for stuff I couldn't figure out.This was fun to make but, as a beginner I still worry if my code is too clunky or sloppily written. 


HOW TO USE THE WEBPAGE:
 first, read the page. then fill out the required information. if you leave any info out, the page will tell you to enter it because it uses FROM VALIDATION...    
 ( UPDATE: if you make the form request any info from you after NOT following instructions, you have 1 minute to fix your errors... that is more than enough time I think. There is a slight quirk with the page where within that minute after the message is generated, you can duplicate multiples of that same message until the button times out... beginner struggles... )
 
 anyways, click the submit button and read a "Mad libs" style message thats really sweet and uplifting. After you read, have fun with the color changing, affirmation click button until you get tired... Enjoy!
