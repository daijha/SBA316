# SBA316
Hello again this is the README  for my third Skills Based Assesment (SBA) for coding bootcamp. This test was a lot more fun than the last one. The last one was so brutal that the letters SBA hurts to hear. Hahaha.... 

Anyways, I decided to repatch my heart together from the damage by creating a sweet webpage filled with affirmative speech. This page is for anyone to use when they need to hear some nice words. 

this project was made using mostly DOM manipulation along with some CSS styling. I only used one id  in the HTML file. (I almost made the whole form there). It was fun to make but, as a beginner I still worry if my code is too clunky or sloppily written. 

But that's enought rambling ...
HOW TO USE THE WEBPAGE:
 first, read the page. then fill out the required information. if you leave any info out, the page will tell you to enter it because it uses FROM VALIDATION... anyways, click the submit button and read a "Mad libs" style message thats really sweet and uplifting. After you read, have fun with the color changing, affirmation click button until you get tired... Enjoy!
